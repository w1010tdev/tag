# Implementation Summary - Social Connect

## Complete Implementation

A modern, full-featured networking platform has been successfully implemented with all requested features.

## Features Implemented

### Core Requirements (All Completed)

#### 1. User Management
- **Admin Registration System**: Admins generate one-time tokens for user registration
- **User Registration**: Users register with admin-provided tokens
- **Authentication**: Secure login/logout with password hashing
- **Admin Panel**: Password-protected backend for managing users and tokens

#### 2. Invitation Token System
- **Unique Tokens**: Each user can generate cryptographically secure invite tokens
- **One-Time Use**: Tokens automatically invalidate after use
- **Refreshable**: Users can generate new tokens anytime
- **Secure**: 256-bit random tokens using Python's secrets module

#### 3. Connection Management
- **Easy Connection**: Users share invite links to establish connections
- **Connection Dashboard**: View all connections in one place
- **Persistent**: Connections stored in database

#### 4. Shared Clipboard (Real-Time)
- **Dual Text Areas**: Each user has their own writing space
- **Real-Time Sync**: Changes sync via WebSocket instantly
- **Debounced Updates**: Efficient 500ms debounce for performance
- **Persistent Storage**: Content saved to database

#### 5. Drawing Game (Pictionary)
- **Turn-Based Gameplay**: Players take turns drawing and guessing
- **Real-Time Drawing**: Strokes sync instantly via WebSocket
- **3 Guesses**: Guesser gets 3 attempts per round
- **Drawing Tools**: Color picker, brush size, clear canvas
- **Touch Support**: Works on mobile devices
- **Game State**: Tracks drawer, answer, guesses, completion
